How to auto fill clock-in information in [Bamboo-HR](https://bamboohr.com).

If I remember correctly, this is a fork of [ribugent](https://github.com/ribugent/bamboohr-timesheet-greasemonkey), which in turn is a fork of [skgsergio](https://github.com/skgsergio/greasemonkey-scripts). The first one should be updated, too.

### Instructions

Use some automatic script addon in your browser, like [GreaseMonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/) (I'm using [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) in Firefox, if the script does not work in you particular browser, please fill an issue or, better yet, open a pull request).

Add the contents of `script.js` as a new script in your addon.

Have fun with all the time you saved!
