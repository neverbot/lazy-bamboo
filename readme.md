How to auto fill clock-in information in [Bamboo-HR](https://bamboohr.com).

### Instructions

Use some automatic script addon in your browser, like [GreaseMonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/) (I'm using [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) in Firefox, if the script does not work in you particular browser, please fill an issue or, better yet, open a pull request).

Add the contents of `script.js` as a new script in your addon.

Have fun with all the time you saved!
